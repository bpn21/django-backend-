""" in Modelforms Meta class we donâ€™t initialise user model 
via importing from models.py as usual but
 instead we are referring to settings.py initialisation.
  Hence we called get_user_model() method which in turn returns our custom user class.
   This is the recommended best practise to follow. 
   This can be same in any other app where user model is to be instantiated.
    Further we return the views based on the user action. Lets code for views in views.py"""
